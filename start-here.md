This is an open source documentation for **Love First**.

### What is Love First

Love First is a catch-all identifier for all people and things that prioritize a love for humanity and planet in their actualization. 

Love First is an open source effort to reimagine humanity in sustainable, interdependent, and connected ways, with practices, tools, and guidance for people to coexist in harmonious divergence.

### What is Universal Love

Love, in the sense that most people think of it, is heavily limited to strong romantic, familiar, or platonic feelings for other people, animals, and sometimes things. 

Universal Love takes this notion to its natural endpoint. Love First defines it as:

> A strong feeling of connection with, affection for, and appreciation of _everything_ the universe contains.

Love First is a practice in understanding that you can come to a place of having love for everything and everyone, a practice in cultivating Universal Love within yourself. The benefits of these practices are numerous, but some highlights:

* Hope and optimism for a better life, a better world, and a better future;
* Clarity on the truth of your life, improving self-efficacy and awareness;
* A stronger feeling of connection, safety and security with your community;
* Greater courage and resilience in an ever-changing world.

#### **Context Matters: “Love” is Universal Love**

For convenience purposes, any use of the word “love” in this entire documentation should be interpreted to mean Universal Love, unless otherwise specified.
